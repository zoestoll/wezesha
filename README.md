How to Run
==========
in the working directory, run node server.js
open browser and go to http://localhost:8080 (will eventually serve to www.wezeshakupaa.org, which our client owns)
navigate the site using the nav buttons on the top

Current Progress
================
We have our backend structure almost complete - we are currently hosting on localhost, which we will later move to 
our client's website. We have all the pages that our client requested, with content partially filled for the ones 
that our client has provided. Our login page, which is partially functional, directs the user to an admin page in which
our client, Pamela, will be able to edit the contents of the website without too much trouble. 

Upcoming Tasks 
==============
1. Our News page, which is the "blog" portion of the website that presents and gets updated with new information, will potentially be re-done in blog format using npm modules (ex. blogging, hexo). 

2. The Home, About and Sponsors page will be updated with real content and images.

3. Our Donations page will redirect to a secure PayPal form page where they can donate via PayPal. 

4. Our Maps and Login pages will store the information to a backend database and the login page will be secure and safe from attacks.

5. Finally, our website will undergo major changes in design, in terms of color, font, layout, etc.
